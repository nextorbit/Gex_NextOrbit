COMPARISON TOOL
===============


The Comparison Tool of the platform offers insights on the sales, Out of Stock and Inventory level of the products and allows us to compare them. The global filters allow you to draw these insights for products across all levels of hierarchy. The default time range for which insights are presented on first load is the current week. This can be changed with the help of the time filter in the top right portion of the screen.
